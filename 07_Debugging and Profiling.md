
# 7- Debugging and Profiling

## Exercise

Q1. Use journalctl on Linux or log show on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day. If there arenâ€™t any you can execute some harmless commands such as sudo ls and check again

```sh
sudo ls .
journalctl --since yesterday
# returns --No entries--
# journalctl based on systemd, which is disabled in WSL2 
# no files at /var/log/syslog or /var/log/journal/*
```

```sh
sudo service rsyslog start # start syslog in wsl
logger "hello logs"
cat /var/log/syslog | grep hello
```

Q2. Do this hands on pdb tutorial to familiarize yourself with the commands. For a more in depth tutorial read this

Q3. Install shellcheck and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically

```sh
# On Debian based distros
sudo apt install shellcheck
shellcheck 07shellcheck.sh -s bash
```

Install shell-format pluggin on VScode based on shellcheck
Q4. (Advanced) Read about reversible debugging and get a simple example working using rr or RevPDB.

Q5. Here are some sorting algorithm implementations. Use cProfile and line_profiler to compare the runtime of insertion sort and quicksort. What is the bottleneck of each algorithm? Use then memory_profiler to check the memory consumption, why is insertion sort better? Check now the inplace version of quicksort. Challenge: Use perf to look at the cycle counts and cache hits and misses of each algorithm

```bash
# Check runtime with cprofile
python -m cProfile -s time 07sorts.py
python -m cProfile -s time 07sorts.py | grep 07sorts.py
```

```bash
# Check bottleneck with line profiler
pip install line_profiler
# decorate function to be tested with @profile and run 
kernprof -l -v 07sorts.py
```

```bash
# Check memory profiler
pip install memory_profiler
# decorate function to be tested with @profile and run 
python -m memory_profiler 07sorts.py
```

```bash
# Check cycle counts and cache hits and misses
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic 
# not available in WSL 2 : https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/8480
```
